Why do I want to learn how to code? Simple answer...to pursue my goals in life. So what are my life goals? My first goal is to make my family proud and to give back to my parents who dedicated their lives to my brother and me. My second goal is to give back to the country where I was born and raised. My third goal is to always find a way to make any situation positive. So how do these life goals come back to coding?

When I started reading about coding, I noticed six things... 1. I like computers/tech, 2. I like challenges, 3. Impact is big - coding is used everywhere and posibilities are almost limitless, 4. Working remotely is possible, 5. Demand for coders is high, 6. Pay is above average. These six things made me realiaze that through coding I will be albe to fulfill my goals earlier in life. So far, its definitely been a challenge but I'm enjoying the beginining of this journey. I can't wait to see where I'll be after completing the bootcamp.
