After a few months of moving out of old place and moving back to Guatemala, I finally have set a schedule where I can include some coding everyday. I'mr eally excited to learn python and know more about the language because I think its one of those languages that not everyone talks about. I think its going to be a great challenge and I I'm happy I'll get a chance to tackle it.
