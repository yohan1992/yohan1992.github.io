A couple nights ago, my parents asked me a great question; why do you want to learn coding and what are your end goals? This left me thinking for a while just because they really put me on the spot and I had no answer that I was 100% sure of. But after a few days of thinking, I knew why I wanted to learn coding. In the long run, I think coding will help me get into the coding world (software development, back end, frond end, etc) and that has been something that I have been fascinated about since I first started. Learning how to code would allow me to chose from a variety of companies and it would even give me the set of skills to make an app, game, etc myself. I still have to set some hard goals for myself but I think this is going the right way.
