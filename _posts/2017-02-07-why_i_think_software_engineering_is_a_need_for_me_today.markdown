Before starting to learn how to code, I always wanted to step out of my comfort zone, challenge myself and learn something new. As I started to read more about the possibilities and opportunities that coding gives us, I realized I wanted to learn it so I could eventually work as a freelancer, get a chance to work in a big company (Uber, Google, Airbnb, etc) or even create my own app or website. With the new U.S. president on board, and the uncertainty it has left for many that require a H1-B visa (me), I've come to realize that I need to learn coding to give myself a wider set of opportunities and not limit myself with what I know now (Marketing and Business Major). Learning how to code and program would allow me to work for companies from around the world from anywhere in the world.
