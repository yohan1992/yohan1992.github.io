It has been really hard to learn coding for now just because I haven't been hard on myself when it comes down to coding. After a few days of thinking about a way on how to be better at it, I created two personal goals that I think will help me learn coding at a quicker pace. Up to now, I would do coding anytime I would have free time. It did work for a couple of weeks until I would decide to invest that time into working out or playing soccer. After talking to my mentor, I came to realize that I skippped one of the basics when it comes down to learn anything, to set goals and a logical/real schedule to do so. Starting next week, I will organize my schedule and set a time and day to learn how to code everyday or at least a couple times a week to begin with. Not having a schedule has made it hard to become proficient and sometimes I feel like I loose my way. I also have a set a personal goal to finish the learn course in 6 months. I still have to write down some details as to how I am going to do that (perfecting my schedule) and have more detailed goals (how many lessons/week or how many lessons do I want to finish everyime I'm on Learn).
